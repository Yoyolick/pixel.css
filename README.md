# pixel.css
A tool to generate pure css and html pixel art from images.
## Usage
1. Clone this repo or download the `main.py` file from the releases.
2. Run the `main.py` file in the terminal, with the only argument being a path to the image you wish to use.

**if you get any errors at this step, make sure you are providing an accurate path to an image, or try putting the image and the `main.py` file in the same directory and path to it locally**

3. see the generated directory for results!

## Issues

Im realizing after the fact that I could have just embeded the class inside the html file, and will implement that if i ever return to this.
